# Year 3 Biocomputation

I did the optimisation task. The task is to carry on from worksheet 3 and implement some other operators and to show competitive performance on a variety of numerical functions. Also to demonstrate the effects of parameter changes through graphs, and include an understanding of what is happening. The approaches that i should consider are different forms of mutation and crossover, as well as selection. 

NOTE: This project has not been the best of my capability, however, I did pass this module.
